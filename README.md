## Overview

In Week 2, we focused on mastering **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts, which form the foundation of Java application development. You will learn how to design robust, maintainable, and reusable code using core OOP principles.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Classes and Objects
- What is a class?
- Creating objects from classes
- Instance variables and methods
- Object creation and memory concepts

### Day 2: Constructors and this Keyword
- Creating constructors
- Constructor overloading
- Use of the `this` keyword to resolve variable shadowing
- Calling one constructor from another using `this()`

### Day 3: Inheritance
- What is inheritance?
- `extends` keyword and single inheritance
- Accessing superclass members
- `super` keyword usage

### Day 4: Polymorphism
- Compile-time (method overloading)
- Runtime (method overriding)
- Dynamic method dispatch
- Use of `instanceof`

### Day 5: Abstraction and Interfaces
- Abstract classes and methods
- Interface definition and implementation
- Multiple inheritance with interfaces
- Real-world examples using abstraction

### Day 6: Access Modifiers, Static, and Final Keywords
- `public`, `private`, `protected`, `default` access
- Class-level and method-level `static` variables/methods
- `final` keyword for constants and method restrictions
